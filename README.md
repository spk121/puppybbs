An update of T Jennings' minimalist, late-1980s Puppy BBS.

So there this California-based guy named Tom Jennings who does a lot of stuff in the intersection between tech and art.
Once upon a time he was a driving force behind FidoNet, which was a pre-internet community of dial-up BBSs.
He's done many cool things since FidoNet.

And there there is me, Mike Gran.  I like old things.  One time, whilst digging through some old CD-ROMS
over at textfiles.com, I found source code for something called Puppy BBS.  I guess Tom wrote it as a reaction
to how complicated BBSs had become back in the late 1980s.  So it is just about the simplest BBS one could
imagine.

I found it in here: http://cd.textfiles.com/simtel/simtel20/MSDOS/FIDO/.index.html

So I thought, hey, does this thing still build and run?  Well, not exactly.  First off, it uses
a MS-DOS C library that handles serial comms, which, of course, doesn't work on Microsoft Windows 10
or on Linux.  And even if that library did still exist, I couldn't try it even if I wanted to.
I mean, if I wanted to try it
I would need two landlines and two dial-up modems so I could call myself.  I do have a dial-up modem
in a box in the garage, but,
I'm not going to get another landline for this nonsense.

But, there is such a thing as a BBS over Telnet.  There are a few that still exist.

Anyway, I e-mailed Tom and asked if I could hack it up and post it on Github, and he said okay.  And so this
is what that is.

I did already haxor the crap out of it once.  But now, I'm going to do it again with a bit more rigor.

Note that the license for all this is non-standard and weird and doesn't really qualify as "free" or
"open source" in the modern understanding of such things.
